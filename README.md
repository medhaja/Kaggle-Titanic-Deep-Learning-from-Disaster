## Description

Solving the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster problem using Tensorflow Deep Neural network architecture. This is a Regression problem. the model is trained on the train dataset with validation split ratio is 20%. After the training process, the test data is used to predict the survival and a submission file is created which has to be submitted to Kaggle compition. The accuracy was around 77%.

#### Technologies

- Tensorflow 2.2
- Python 3.7

## How To Use
### Install Jupyter notebook
[ [Install-jupyter-notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)]

### Download the data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## So now our project folder contains this file structure:
~~~
  ├── .gitignore
  ├── train.csv
  ├── test.csv
  └── regression.ipynb
~~~

### run this command in Command prompt

```
    jupyter notebook regression.ipynb
```
